In 1944, she was promoted to lieutenant and given a job at Harvard University's Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project, where she worked on the Mark I, the first large-scale automatic calculator and an early form of an electronic computer. Hopper wrote a 500-page Manual of Operations for the Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator in which she outlined the fundamental operating principles of computing machines.Hopperâ€™s work with computers not only gained national attention, but she also recieved global recognition.
